I created this repo as a resource for myself for using in competitions.

### Algorithm Resources

* [CodeChef-Data Structures and Algorithms Discuss](http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/48877/data-structures-and-algorithms)
* [Must Know Algorithms](http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18752/what-are-the-must-known-algorithms-for-online-programming-contests)

### Where should I compete?

* [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
* [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/)
* [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com/) -- Doesn't support Golang
